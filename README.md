# Generalized Linear Models
This is a repository to store my individual project from my Generalized Linear Models undergraduate class. I used R to produce logistic models that analyze the factors that affect the diagnosis of cardiovascular health. The dataset I used was sourced from kaggle. In this repository, you can find the following files:

#### 1. Abstract (.pdf)
Contains the goals of my project, why I created my logistic models, and what are the implications of my findings

#### 2. work (.R)
Contains all the R commands I performed for my analyses

#### 3. Presentation (.pdf)
Contains the slides I used in my class presentation
